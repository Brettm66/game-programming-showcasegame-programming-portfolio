## About Me
Hi, I'm Brett McDonald, an aspiring gameplay programmer with a growing passion for game development. I have intermediate skills in C++ and C#, and I'm excited to share my journey as I continue to learn and improve. This portfolio showcases some of my early projects, and I look forward to updating it with more advanced and polished work as I gain more experience. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my projects!

## Projects
Project 1: Speedometer Calculator
Description: This project is a speedometer calculator designed to help users determine the actual speed of their vehicle based on the tire sizes (old and new). The program is modular, with separate components for the menu, input, calculation, filling the array, and displaying the output. Users can input the old and new tire sizes, and the program calculates the difference between the actual speed of the vehicle and what the speedometer shows in 10 mph increments from 10 to 100 mph. The actual speeds are calculated dynamically within a loop by calling a module and passing in the ratio and speed needed for the calculation. The program also allows users to run the calculations multiple times.

Features:
Modular design with separate components for different functionalities.
User input for old and new tire sizes.
Calculation of actual speed based on tire size ratio.
Display of speed differences in 10 mph increments from 10 to 100 mph.
Ability to run the program multiple times.

Technologies Used: C++, C#
